Great Work Shazia,

A few comments in general:

- Be careful when creating singletons, like your viewmodel and manager, as they can have strange behaviours or create crashes.

- I noticed that you specified sizes, frames and etc for your SwiftUI views. We're going to discuss this a bit more during the  next few meetings, but SwiftUI has a more declarative approach, where you shouldn't necessarily try to control every detail.

- Your HomeView file contains multiple views and even a viewmodel, which could make it confusing to navigate in the future, try to maintain only a component per file, that could make your life easier
